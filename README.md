# autoloader
sample autoloader using namespaces and show example how to autoload classes and implementing interface
When I started to use the framework, among the questions I asked, how does this framework include all these various files and why do we use namespaces instead of using include or require.
That's why I answered my question through this autoloader which is inspired by the autoloader of Nilpo https://github.com/Nilpo/autoloader
using namespaces and a later version of PHP which is version 7 
and all the rest of it is on the same principle that it's a simple example just to understand the notion of the autoloader.
I am pleased to share with you this example all remarks modifications or suggestions for improvement are welcome
